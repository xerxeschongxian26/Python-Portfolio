* Find PI to the Nth Digit - readme.txt

Files Includes With This Project:
 
      FindPI2Digit.py
      
  FindPI2Digit.py get the value of PI to n number of decimal places using the Chudnovsky Algorithm <br>

* How To Run "Find PI to the Nth Digit":

1) Ensure all project files are within the same directory
2) All files can be ran individually from the command line or in the IDE of choice

* Notes on project:
 
  Credits goes to the original author: Pradipta (GitHub user: geekpradd) for the original source code <br>
  Changes made include changing the output of the factorial functions to a Decimal type and the use of a personal script to calculate the factorial <br>
  
  Setting to a Decimal type has increased the accuracy of PI from 12dp in the original source code to 28 dp. More needs to be investigated <br>
  
   Output of FindPI2Digit.py accurate up to 28dp when precision set to 35dp      : 3.1415926535897932384626433832
   Output of original source code accurate up to 12dp when precision set to 35dp : 3.141592653589
