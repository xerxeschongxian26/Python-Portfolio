* Factorial Calculator - readme.txt

Files Includes With This Project:
 
      factorial_loop.py    factorial_recursion.py  tester_factorial.py
      
 * factorial_loop.py calculates the factorial of a number using loops 
 * factorial_recursion.py calculates the factorial of a number using recursion 
 * tester_factorial.py compares the speed of each method by counting the total time for each method to calculate 500! over 100,000 times

* How To Run "Factorial Calculator":

1) Ensure all project files are within the same directory
2) All files can be ran individually from the command line or in the IDE of choice

* Notes on project:
 
  For large values of factorials, the recursion method is limited by memory usage due to the constant calling of the function itself
  Hence, for large values, the loops method is superior. That being said, the recursion method is an elegant solution. This difference in speed
  is demonstrated by running tester_factorial.py
