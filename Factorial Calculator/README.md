* Factorial Calculator - readme.txt

Files Includes With This Project:
 
      factorial_loop.py    factorial_recursion.py  tester_factorial.py
      


* How To Run "Factorial Calculator":

1) Ensure all project files are within the same directory
2) All files can be ran individually from the command line or in the IDE of choice

* Notes on project:
 
  For large values of factorials, the recursion method is limited by memory usage due to the constant calling of the function itself
  Hence, for large values, the loops method is superior. That being said, the recursion method is an elegant solution. This difference in speed
  is demonstrated by running the tester_factorial.py script which calculates the total time taken to run each method over n number of cycles
