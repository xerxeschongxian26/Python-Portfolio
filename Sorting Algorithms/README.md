* Sorting Algorithms - readme.txt

Files Includes With This Project:
 
      sort_Bubble.py    sort_Selection.py
      
  sort_Bubble.py sorts an array of numbers from lowest to highest using the Bubble Sort Method <br>
  sort_Selection.py sorts an array of numbers from lowest to highest using the Selection Sort Method <br>

* How To Run "Sorting Algorithms":

1) Ensure all project files are within the same directory
2) All files can be ran individually from the command line or in the IDE of choice

* Notes on project:
 
  sort_Bubble.py has similar performance to an online solution but it's speed seems to fluctuate at higher number of cycles when tested with timeit <br>
  Changes made include changing the output of the factorial functions to a Decimal type and the use of a personal script to calculate the factorial <br>
  
  Setting to a Decimal type has increased the accuracy of PI from 12dp in the original source code to 28 dp. More needs to be investigated <br>
